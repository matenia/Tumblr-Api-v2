# Tumblr API Version 2

### Note from Tumblr

Welcome to the Tumblr API! There isn't anything we enjoy more than seeing talented designers and engineers using Tumblr to invent whole new forms of creative expression.  We've put a tremendous amount of care into making this API functional and flexible enough for any projects you throw at it.  Join us in our discussion group to talk about how to use it, what could be better, and all the amazing things you're going to build with it. Please use the API responsibly, and send us your feedback.  Enjoy!
